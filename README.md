https://medium.com/coinmonks/linear-regression-with-tensorflow-canned-estimators-6cc4ffddd14f This project is about implementing Linear Regression using TensorFlow using canned estimators. Canned Estimators are a high-level API, different from the low-level API that requires you program everything yourself. Starting by importing the required libraries.
